    content: '<p>Mainly companies for which I provide services work on <span class="fw-bold text-primary">Bootstrap</span>, so and everything that others do in Javascript, I make up for it using <span class="fw-bold text-primary">SCSS</span> and <span class="fw-bold text-primary">HTML</span>. I mainly get a graphic design and cut it to a clean code, and then it is hooked up to a dedicated CMS system. I also worked on <span class="fw-bold text-primary">Wordpress</span> using Enfold, Divi, Bridge and Jupiter. Learning <span class="fw-bold text-primary">Vue</span> and <span class="fw-bold text-primary">React</span> is my goal for the near future.</p>'
